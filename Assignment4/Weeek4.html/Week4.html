        <a href="#"><img src="PeterGriffin.png"></a>
        <p>Peter Löwenbräu Griffin is the protagonist and title 
            character of Family Guy. He was born on july 22 1955 in 
            mexico to mickey and thelma griffin.He's of Irish descent 
            and lives in Quahog, Rhode Island with his wife, Lois and 
            their three children, Meg, Chris and Stewie. He also lives 
            with his intellectual talking dog, Brian. He is best friends 
            with sex-obsessed neighbour, Quagmire, deli-owner Cleveland 
            and wheelchair-bound, Joe. Peter is shown to have little 
            intelligence. This is backed by an episode revolving around 
            an I.Q. test Peter takes placing him in a category below 
            mentally retarded. He is constantly getting into accidents
            which often end up with other people being hurt; most notably
            his father, Francis Griffin. Peter's attention span is
            also incredibly short.
